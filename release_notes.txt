Video Streamer v1.0
===================

The QML Video Streamer example application showcases the QML video streaming 
and playing capabilities, and Qt Mobility bindings to Multimedia package and
the QML Video element. The QML Video Streamer application has been designed
to use the official Qt Quick Components for navigation and UI look'n'feel.

The customized QML Video player has been componentized so, that any 3rd party
developer can take it use it in his/her own QML application. One showcase of
this approach is the QML Media Browser example application.

The QML Video Streamer also utilises Qt Quick Components in numerous places.
For example, when navigating deeper into the application the PageStack is used.
The StatusBar and ToolBar (with all the ToolButtons etc.) are used as well.

KNOWN ISSUES & DESIGN LIMITATIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Video streaming might not start on some device & operator combos. This might
  be due to the used video streaming access point. Changing it can help. Select:
  "Menu" - "Settings" - "Application settings" - "Videos" - "Access point in use"
  to change the currently used streaming access point (i.e. in Symbian devices).

After video playback there are severe performance bugs.
- https://bugreports.qt.nokia.com/browse/QTMOBILITY-1570 & -1818

Video play view flickers sometimes and can be seen through.
- https://bugreports.qt.nokia.com/browse/QTMOBILITY-1569

Header item can’t be seen, if navigating with keyboard.
- https://bugreports.qt.nokia.com/browse/QTBUG-20926

Seeking in video is not supported (when using QML Video Player).
- There's support for it in the QML Video element provided 'seekable'-property,
  but unfortunately it does not behave well with streamed content.
